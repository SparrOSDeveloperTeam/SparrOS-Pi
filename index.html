                SparrOS for Embedded Systems gives you a linux system with developer tools such as various compilers to deploy projects for the Raspberry Pi boards, httpd services, and a small amount of emulation. Support for languages such as C and Python and be as versatile as possible. For as long as RPi 0 is supported, we will be building for both ARMEL and ARMHF arch types. SparrOS for Embedded systems is based on the true Linux kernel and hopes to be lightweight as possible. To run SparrOS, you will need a 1GB SD Card (or larger). You can change the size of the <kbd>sparros</kbd> partition via Disks for Debian/Ubuntu/Linux Mint or <kbd>cfdisk</kbd>. SparrOS does not yet have a UI.
